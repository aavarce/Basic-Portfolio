        I am Alicia Valentino, for short just Alice. I didn't think I would be going back to school at this stage of my life. My professional work was as a Cobol programmer. I retired from Credit Suisse, a global Investment company where I worked for 30 years as a Programmer Analyst. I was responsible for the system called Security Master, Foreign Securities &Currencies and Inventory Reporting, both the online and batch side in a mainframe environment. Most of my users are based in New York, London and Hongkong. <br>

        I still have the willingness to get up in the morning and do something productive. It always intrigues me how websites work, how it is built and so finally decided to learn about it. It is very different from COBOL that I am used to. <br>

        There are not that many mainframe companies using Cobol unless you are willing to relocate or travel a long distance. It seems it is being phased out and being replaced or incorporated with new technologies like in website building. I thought it is a good fit for me so I decided to learn the new computer languages used by full-stack developers. There is a lot to learn.<br>

        I have been thinking about this for a while until finally I decided to take action to learn about HTML, CSS, JAVA Script and othe related languages that supports website building.<br>

        <strong>So here I am learning to become a full-stack developer. Who knows, you may want to have your own website built to tell the whole world about your most memorable trip to the moon or your exciting experience as a first time pilot. I may be the one building your website in the future.</strong><br>

        So wish me <strong>LUCK</strong> and join the excitement in my new adventure in life! <br>
