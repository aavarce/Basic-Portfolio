      <p>I am Alicia Valentino, for short just Alice. I didn't think I would be going back to school at this stage of my life. My professional work was being a programmer which I have done for 33 years years in my life, but that is in Cobol, so different from being a website programmer. I retired from Credit Suisse after working for 30 years as a Programmer Analyst.</p>

      <p>I still have the willingness to get up in the morning and do something productive besides having some financial benefit of it being in the work force. I enjoy working especially when you are doing something you love to do. It does not really feel like working, but the feeling of satisfaction of being challenged and succeed with what you are doing. So life is not boring and looking forward what next to accomplish. </p>

      <p>There are now a very few Cobol users in this country especially in the east coast since this language is gradually being phased out. Most are in other states or other countries and are converting to the new technologies of website building. I thought it is a good fit for me so I decided to learn the new computer languages used by full-stack developers. </p>

      <p>I have been thinking about this for a while until finally I decided to take action to learn about HTML, CSS, JAVA Script and othe related languages that supports web building.<p>

      <p><strong>So here I am learning to become a full-stack developer. Who knows, you may want to have your own website built to tell the whole world about your most memorable trip to the moon or your exciting experience as a first time pilot. I may be the one building your website in the future.Gardening</strong></p>

      <p>So wish me <strong>LUCK</strong> and join the excitement in my new adventure in life! </p>
